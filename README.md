# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description 
The motivation for creating this webpage was to prepare myself for the coding bootcamp course and to introduce myself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding languages. The project was an efficient way to summarize all the information provided to me in module 3 of the course prework.  It will prepare me to be successful in the course itself and I feel like I have a decent understanding of the basics of the three languages in addition to using the command line to sync the code on my local computer to the code I save on GitHub.
